# Nova CI-Rescue - Setting Expectations & Success Criteria

## Executive Summary

Nova CI-Rescue v1.0 is a **focused tool for automated test fixing**, not a silver bullet. This document helps you set realistic expectations, understand success criteria, and maximize value from Nova.

## What Nova Is (and Isn't)

### Nova IS ✅

- **An AI assistant** that helps fix simple test failures
- **A time-saver** for routine debugging tasks
- **A first responder** for CI failures
- **A learning tool** that provides fix insights
- **A safety-first system** with built-in guardrails

### Nova is NOT ❌

- **A replacement** for developer debugging skills
- **A magic wand** that fixes all test failures
- **A code quality tool** (it fixes tests, not code design)
- **A test writer** (it fixes existing tests only)
- **A production debugger** (CI/test environment only)

## Realistic Success Expectations

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Nova Will Fix Everything"

**Reality:** Nova fixes ~70% of simple issues, ~30% of complex ones
**Adjustment:** Use Nova as first-pass, not last resort

### Misconception 2: "Nova Understands My Code"

**Reality:** Nova pattern-matches and reasons about errors
**Adjustment:** Nova fixes symptoms it can see in tests

### Misconception 3: "More Iterations = Better Fix"

**Reality:** Diminishing returns after 3-4 iterations
**Adjustment:** If not fixed by iteration 4, go manual

### Misconception 4: "Nova's Fix Is Always Optimal"

**Reality:** Nova fixes tests, may not fix root cause
**Adjustment:** Always review the logic, not just results

### Misconception 5: "Failed Run = Wasted Time"

**Reality:** Nova's analysis helps even when fixes fail
**Adjustment:** Check logs for insights on manual fix

## Maximizing Success

### 1. Start Small

```bash
# Good: Target specific test file
nova fix . --test-file tests/test_utils.py

# Less Good: Entire test suite
nova fix .
```

### 2. Set Conservative Limits

```yaml
# Recommended for starting out
max_iters: 3 # Not 6
timeout: 300 # Not 1200
max_changed_lines: 100 # Not 500
```

### 3. Review Everything

```bash
# Always review changes before merging
git diff HEAD~1  # See what Nova changed
git log -1       # Check commit message
pytest           # Verify tests pass
```

### 4. Learn from Failures

```bash
# When Nova fails, check why
cat .nova/latest/trace.jsonl | grep "error"
cat .nova/latest/trace.jsonl | grep "reflect"
# Use insights for manual fix
```

### 5. Track Metrics

```python
# Simple tracking script
import json
from pathlib import Path

nova_runs = Path(".nova").glob("*/trace.jsonl")
success_count = 0
total_runs = 0

for run in nova_runs:
    with open(run) as f:
        for line in f:
            event = json.loads(line)
            if event.get("exit_reason") == "SUCCESS":
                success_count += 1
        total_runs += 1

print(f"Success Rate: {success_count/total_runs*100:.1f}%")
```
