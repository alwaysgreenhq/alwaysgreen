# üìã Design Review (DR) Audit Checklist

## Overview

This checklist is used to conduct Design Review audits after each milestone completion. Each DR audit ensures quality, consistency, and readiness before proceeding to the next milestone.

---

## üéØ DR Audit Process

### When to Conduct
- **Timing**: Within 24-48 hours after milestone completion
- **Duration**: 2-4 hours per audit
- **Participants**: Tech lead, Developer, and optionally a peer reviewer

### How to Use This Checklist
1. Complete all items in the relevant milestone section
2. Mark items as ‚úÖ Pass, ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (non-blocking), or ‚ùå Fail (must fix)
3. Create follow-up issues for any failures
4. Document decisions and rationale in the Notes section

## üìù Milestone A-DR: Local E2E Audit

### Technical Architecture Review
- [ ] **Code Structure**: Follows project patterns and conventions
- [ ] **Modularity**: Components are properly separated and reusable
- [ ] **Dependencies**: No circular dependencies or tight coupling
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- [ ] **Configuration**: Clean separation of config from code

### Test Coverage Audit
- [ ] **Coverage Metrics**: Minimum 80% code coverage achieved
- [ ] **Critical Paths**: All main workflows have tests
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and edge cases tested
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests are meaningful (not just for coverage)
- [ ] **Test Performance**: Tests run within acceptable time limits

### Code Quality & Standards
- [ ] **Linting**: All linting rules pass without errors
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Python type hints used consistently
- [ ] **Documentation**: Functions/classes have docstrings
- [ ] **Comments**: Complex logic is well-commented
- [ ] **Naming**: Clear, consistent naming conventions

## üìù Milestone B-DR: Quiet CI & Telemetry Audit

### Telemetry & Observability Review
- [ ] **Logging Coverage**: All critical operations logged
- [ ] **Log Levels**: Appropriate use of DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR
- [ ] **Metrics**: Key performance metrics captured
- [ ] **Tracing**: Request flow can be traced end-to-end
- [ ] **Privacy**: No sensitive data in logs

### Package & Dependency Audit
- [ ] **Dependencies**: All dependencies properly declared
- [ ] **Versions**: Dependency versions pinned appropriately
- [ ] **Conflicts**: No dependency conflicts
- [ ] **Security**: No known security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **License**: All dependencies have compatible licenses

### CI Integration Validation
- [ ] **Output Format**: CI-friendly output (parseable, not verbose)
- [ ] **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes for success/failure
- [ ] **Artifacts**: Required artifacts generated correctly
- [ ] **Performance**: Runs complete within CI time limits
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Builds are reproducible

## üìù Milestone C-DR: GitHub Action & PR Proof Audit

### Security & Permissions Review
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] **API Keys**: Proper handling of API keys
- [ ] **Token Scopes**: Minimal required permissions
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs properly validated
- [ ] **Injection Prevention**: Protected against code injection

### GitHub Integration Best Practices
- [ ] **Action Structure**: Follows GitHub Actions conventions

## üîÑ DR Audit Outcomes

### Pass Criteria
- All critical items marked as ‚úÖ Pass
- No more than 20% items marked as ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- Zero items marked as ‚ùå Fail

### Actions for Failures
1. **Critical Failures** (‚ùå): Must be fixed before proceeding
2. **Warnings** (‚ö†Ô∏è): Create tracking issues for next sprint
3. **Minor Issues**: Document in notes for future improvement

### Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date | Signature |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| Tech Lead | | | |
| Developer | | | |
| Reviewer | | | |

## üìä Metrics to Track

### Quality Metrics
- Number of issues found per audit
- Time to resolve critical issues
- Percentage of warnings carried forward

### Process Metrics
- Time taken for each audit
- Number of follow-up issues created
- Milestone delivery impact
