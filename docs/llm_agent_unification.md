# LLM Agent Unification - Main Branch

## Summary
Successfully unified the `llm_agent.py` and `llm_agent_enhanced.py` implementations on the main branch, creating a single comprehensive agent with all advanced features.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Unified LLM Agent (`src/nova/agent/llm_agent.py`)
- **Merged all features** from both the basic and enhanced versions
- **Added backward compatibility** with `EnhancedLLMAgent = LLMAgent` alias
- **Deleted redundant file** `llm_agent_enhanced.py`

### 2. Key Features in Unified Agent
- ✅ **Multi-provider support**: OpenAI and Anthropic via `LLMClient`
- ✅ **Source file discovery**: Automatically finds source files from test imports
- ✅ **Advanced patch generation**: 
  - Truncation detection and continuation
  - Format fixing with `_fix_patch_format()`
  - 8000 token limit (4x improvement)
- ✅ **Safety features**:
  - Patch size limits (1000 lines, 10 files max)
  - Protected file detection
  - Proper diff format validation
- ✅ **Improved planning**:
  - Critic feedback integration
  - Source file identification
  - Systematic test prioritization

### 3. Updated Imports
All references to `EnhancedLLMAgent` have been updated to use the unified `LLMAgent`:
- `src/nova/cli.py`
- `src/nova/cli_enhanced.py`
- `examples/demos/demo_happy_path.py`

### 4. Backward Compatibility
The unified `llm_agent.py` includes an alias at the bottom:
```python
# For backward compatibility, create an alias
EnhancedLLMAgent = LLMAgent
```
This ensures any code still referencing `EnhancedLLMAgent` will continue to work.

## Benefits
1. **Single source of truth**: One file to maintain instead of two
2. **All features available**: No need to choose between basic and enhanced
3. **Cleaner architecture**: Clear separation between agent logic and LLM provider
4. **Easier testing**: One implementation to test
5. **Better maintainability**: Reduced code duplication

## Migration Guide
For any code using the old structure:
```python
# Old way (either of these):
from nova.agent.llm_agent import LLMAgent  # Basic version
from nova.agent.llm_agent_enhanced import EnhancedLLMAgent  # Enhanced version

# New way (unified):
from nova.agent.llm_agent import LLMAgent  # Has all features

# The alias means this also works:
from nova.agent.llm_agent import EnhancedLLMAgent  # Points to LLMAgent
```

## Technical Details
The unified agent uses:
- `LLMClient` from `llm_client.py` for provider abstraction
- Helper functions: `parse_plan`, `build_planner_prompt`, `build_patch_prompt`
- Type hints with `Tuple` from `typing` for compatibility

## Status
✅ **Complete** - All functionality unified and tested on main branch
