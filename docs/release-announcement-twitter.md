🚀 Introducing Nova CI-Rescue: The AI agent that automatically fixes your failing tests!

We just released v0.1.1-alpha - turning hours of debugging into minutes of automated fixes.

Here's how it works 🧵👇

## Thread 2: The Problem

2/ We've all been there:
❌ CI pipeline fails
⏰ Spend hours debugging
🔍 Track down the issue
🔧 Fix the test
🔄 Push, wait, repeat

What if an AI agent could do this for you?

## Thread 3: The Solution

3/ Nova CI-Rescue is an LLM-powered agent that:

✅ Detects failing tests automatically
✅ Analyzes the failure patterns
✅ Generates intelligent patches
✅ Applies fixes safely
✅ Verifies the solution works

All in ≤ 3 iterations!

## Thread 4: How It Works

4/ Simple as:

```bash
nova fix /path/to/repo
```

Nova's agent loop:
Planner → Actor → Critic → Apply → Test → Reflect

Each step is logged with full telemetry, so you know exactly what's happening.

## Thread 5: Safety First

5/ We built safety into the core:

🛡️ Sandboxed execution
🚫 File/LOC change limits
📝 Detailed audit trails
🔒 Blocked path protection
⚡ Timeout controls

Your codebase is safe while Nova works its magic.
