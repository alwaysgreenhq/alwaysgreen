# Nova CI-Rescue v0.2.0-legacy

## Archive Date

January 15, 2025

## Description

This release represents the final state of the Nova CI-Rescue system before transitioning to the LangChain Deep Agent architecture. This implementation used a custom multi-node pipeline with:

- **Planner Node**: Analyzed failing tests and created fix strategies
- **Actor Node**: Applied code modifications based on the plan
- **Critic Node**: Reviewed and validated patches for safety
- **Reflect Node**: Handled iteration logic and refinement
- **Test Runner**: Sandboxed test execution with Docker

## Key Components

- Custom LLM agent implementation (`agent/llm_agent.py`)
- State management system (`agent/state.py`)
- Multi-stage pipeline nodes (`nodes/`)
- Sandbox test runner with Docker isolation
- File system and git tools

## Status

**ARCHIVED** - Superseded by LangChain Deep Agent implementation (v0.3.0+)

## Notes

This version successfully demonstrated the concept of automated CI test repair but has been replaced with a more robust LangChain-based architecture that provides:

- Better tool orchestration
- More reliable agent behavior
- Simplified maintenance
- Enhanced extensibility
