Great—I'll review both PRs and associated issues in `novasolve/ci-auto-rescue`, assess how well the code integrates with the intended CI-Rescue architecture, check correctness, and identify remaining tasks to reach a functioning happy path. I’ll report back shortly with a concise summary of what's in place, what's missing, and the next concrete steps you can take.


## Current Implementation Status

**Project Scaffold & Configuration:** The codebase is now structured with the planned directories and config files. A `pyproject.toml` was added declaring all dependencies (e.g. LangGraph, Pydantic, Typer, unidiff, httpx, etc.) and defining the console entry point. The repository contains the expected package layout under `src/nova/` (agent, nodes, tools, llm, openswe, sdk, etc.), a CLI module, evals folder, and telemetry setup. Environment variable handling is implemented via `NovaSettings` (Pydantic) in `settings.py`, which loads API keys and policy limits from `.env` (using python-dotenv) and provides a `get_settings()` helper. A telemetry logger (`TelemetryRun` / `JSONLLogger`) is in place to record runs to `.nova/` artifact folders, with methods to log events and save artifacts (diffs, test reports, etc.). Sensitive info is automatically redacted in logs.

**Core Tools Implemented:** All essential tooling for file edits, git, test running, search, and sandboxing is completed. For example, `src/nova/tools/patcher.py` can apply unified diff patches with safety checks (e.g. prevents modifying tests/ by default, enforces diff size limits, and performs backups/rollbacks on failure). A `git_tool.py` provides functions to ensure or create a branch (e.g. `nova-fix/<timestamp>`), commit all changes, reset to HEAD, etc., using subprocess calls with robust error handling. The `pytest_runner.py` can execute Pytest with a timeout and produce a JUnit XML/JSON report, which is parsed into a structured result (list of failing tests with messages/tracebacks). A basic code search (`search.py`) and resource-limited sandbox execution (`sandbox.py` for CPU/mem limits on subprocesses) are also in place. These tools correspond to the planned MVP functionality and have been unit-tested in isolation where possible (e.g. CLI help output was checked later, indicating the package imports are working).

**LLM & OpenSWE Integration:** The integration with AI services is set up. `src/nova/llm/client.py` defines an `LLMClient` supporting OpenAI and Anthropic, with network call retries and a domain allowlist for safety. It can execute completions with system/user prompts and even enforce JSON schema hints, raising a `NotConfiguredError` if no API keys are provided (so the user is alerted to configure keys). Prompt templates for the planner/actor/critic steps are defined in `prompts.py`. Similarly, `src/nova/openswe/client.py` provides an `OpenSWEClient` to call the OpenSWE “coder” service with appropriate request/response dataclasses and allowlist enforcement. This means the heavy code-generation capabilities are ready to be used when the agent decides a step needs external help. All of these are wrapped with telemetry logging hooks (so that each API call can be recorded) and custom exceptions for error handling.

**Agent State Machine (LangGraph) Implementation:** The heart of the system – the autonomous agent loop – has been implemented according to spec. In `src/nova/agent/state.py` and `graph.py` we have an `AgentState` model and a `build_agent` function that composes the state-machine (using LangGraph if available, or a fallback Python loop if not). The agent’s nodes are defined under `src/nova/nodes/`:

* **Planner node:** uses the LLM to propose a plan of steps given the failing test details and context (with a stub/dry-run mode if no LLM is configured).
* **Actor node:** takes a plan step and generates a code patch (diff) via the LLM; in dry-run mode it skips actual changes.
* **Critic node:** checks the diff (size, scope) and can optionally run an LLM “review” prompt to approve or reject the change. In dry-run it auto-approves everything.
* **ApplyPatch node:** applies the diff to the filesystem using the patcher tool and commits via the git tool. (In dry-run, it skips applying but simulates the step increment.)
* **RunTests node:** re-runs `pytest` on the repo to see if the failing tests have turned green. The JUnit results are saved to the telemetry artifacts. In dry-run it just returns a placeholder result without rerunning tests.
* **Reflect node:** analyzes the new test results; if some target tests are still failing and iterations remain, it decides whether to loop back for another plan/patch cycle. If tests are all passing (or max iterations reached with no progress), it sets `done=True` to end the loop.

This matches the intended loop: plan → act → criticize → patch → test → reflect (repeat). The agent code tracks state like current step count, list of diffs applied, etc., and enforces the iteration cap. Telemetry events are generated at key points (though fine-grained event logging will be improved soon). By the end of PR #26, the agent could run in a **dry-run mode** through all these steps without making real changes, which was used to verify the wiring of the loop. The next step was to integrate this agent into a user-facing CLI.

**CLI Interface & “Happy Path” Commands:** The latest PR (#28) introduces a Typer-based CLI and ties everything together into a runnable tool. A new module `nova/cli.py` defines a Typer app with two commands: `nova fix` and `nova eval`.

* **`nova fix <repo_path>`**: This command is designed to run the agent on a target repo’s failing tests. It loads the NovaSettings (with options to override `--max-iters` or `--timeout` for that run) and initializes telemetry logging (unless `--no-telemetry` is passed). Before launching the agent, it ensures the repo is a git repo and creates a new fix branch (using the git tool). This branch creation is done at the start to contain the incoming commits; if it fails (e.g. no git or branch exists), the error is caught and it continues on master. The CLI then calls `build_agent(settings, logger)` to get a runnable agent function, and executes it. KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) is handled gracefully – if the user aborts, Nova will reset the repository to its original HEAD (undoing any partial changes) and end the telemetry run cleanly. On completion, it prints a success/failure summary. A `--verbose` flag will dump the full JSON summary of the run (e.g. how many iterations, what tests were fixed, etc.), and the telemetry logs/artifacts remain available in `.nova/` for detailed inspection. Importantly, the CLI is already configured as the console entry point (`nova`) in pyproject, so after installing the package you can run `nova fix` directly.

* **`nova eval --repos <file>`**: This command automates running Nova on a batch of repos for evaluation purposes. It takes a YAML file listing repositories and iterates through each, invoking the same agent on each repo (with telemetry optionally disabled for speed). After each run it collects metrics (success/fail, duration, iterations, etc.) and finally writes an aggregate report to `evals/results/<timestamp>.json` and prints a summary. This is intended to test Nova’s success rate across multiple projects (e.g. the “4-repo eval suite” mentioned in the goals).

The CLI implementation appears complete and has been manually smoke-tested for basic usage: the developer was able to load the CLI and display the help text (meaning the module imports were successful). They also fixed minor bugs during this test (for example, a KeyboardInterrupt handling issue was corrected). At this point, **we have a nearly end-to-end path**: you can install the package, run `nova fix /path/to/my/repo`, and the system should attempt to autonomously turn the tests from red to green by iterating through patches. This satisfies a large part of the “happy path” criteria.

## Integration and Code Correctness

Overall, the pieces of the system have been implemented to spec and integrate logically. The **architecture design is reflected in the code structure**, and each component knows how to interface with the others. For example, the CLI uses `build_agent` from the agent module, which in turn uses the tools (git, pytest, etc.) internally. The `NovaSettings` is used throughout to carry configuration like `max_iters` and timeouts into the agent and tools. The careful use of Pydantic settings and a dotenv means configuration is straightforward (just set up a `.env` with API keys and any non-default limits).

Some integration points to note:

* **Git Branch & Commits:** The plan originally suggested creating the fix branch in the agent’s patch-apply step, but the implementation chose to do it in the CLI up front (before running the agent). This is a sensible approach to ensure all commits happen on a dedicated branch. We should double-check that `apply_patch_node` does not also try to create a branch (it likely doesn’t, since the CLI now handles it). Commits are done via `git_tool.commit_all()` each iteration, so we’ll have a series of commits on the `nova-fix...` branch for each patch applied. After a successful run, the branch contains the fixes; the CLI could potentially print the branch name (it does include it in the summary per the code). Integration here looks correct – the CLI ensures the repo state is ready and isolates changes on a branch.

* **Telemetry Logging:** The telemetry system is partially integrated – key events like LLM requests/responses and OpenSWE calls are logged, but **full node-level tracing is not yet wired in**. The plan’s Task 15 (wiring `logger.log_event` in each node) is still marked incomplete. This means in the current state, the JSONL log may not contain every single action the agent takes (planner/actor/critic steps), although the high-level start/finish and any exceptions are logged. This doesn’t prevent the happy path from working, but it’s a **remaining integration task** for observability. The code already has the placeholders to do this, so adding those calls (and writing out diff artifacts) will be straightforward when you tackle Task 15.

* **LLM Usage and Failing Tests Context:** The planner is designed to “understand failing tests” and create a fix plan accordingly. To do that, the agent needs to know *which tests have failed and why*. In the current setup, it’s implied that before the first planning step, we should gather the list of failing tests (with their error messages) as input. The code has a test runner tool, but how is it invoked initially? From what we see, the agent’s first node is Planner (immediately) – we might need to ensure the agent’s state is initialized with failing test info. One approach is to perform an initial test run **before** starting the agent loop. It’s not explicitly mentioned in the CLI summary, so this could be an integration gap to address. In practice, you’ll likely want `nova fix` to run `pytest` once at the very beginning to collect the failing tests and feed that into the planner’s prompt. (Otherwise, the planner LLM would have no data about what’s failing, unless you manually supply that context.) This is something to verify when you run the tool: if the agent starts planning without any failing test input, it may produce an empty or irrelevant plan. The fix is to call `tools.run_pytest()` at the start of `nova fix` (or inside planner node if not already) to get initial failures. Since the tools are available, implementing this will be quick. It will make the “happy path” truly autonomous by automatically detecting what needs fixing.

* **Global Timeout and Iteration Limits:** These safety controls are implemented. The `build_agent` function wraps the run in a global timeout watchdog (using `settings.run_timeout_sec`, default maybe 20 minutes). If the agent exceeds that time, it will terminate the loop and mark it as done (likely with a message that it timed out). The max iteration count (default 6) is enforced both in the Reflect node logic and as a safeguard in the loop implementation. This is important for correctness to avoid infinite loops. These values can be overridden via CLI flags now, which is great for testing smaller iteration counts first.

* **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** The code includes numerous guardrails for correctness. Patches are applied with validation (no surprises like editing outside the repo or messing with huge chunks of code). If a patch fails to apply, the patcher will rollback partial changes. If an external call is attempted to a non-whitelisted domain, it will raise a `NetworkNotAllowed` to prevent the agent from straying. The CLI catches expected errors (like missing API config) – for example, if no OpenAI/Anthropic key is set, the planner will throw `NotConfiguredError` which the CLI intercepts and logs, rather than crashing the program. KeyboardInterrupt is handled as noted, and the CLI also uses exit codes (exiting with code 130 on interrupt) which is a nice touch for scripting. All of these indicate the code was written carefully to integrate well and fail gracefully.

From a **code-correctness** standpoint, nothing egregious stands out. The architecture matches the design issues, and the PR descriptions indicate that many parts were validated (at least minimally). For instance, they parsed JUnit results and structured them, verified CLI help, and imported modules in a test scenario. Of course, the real proof will be running `nova fix` on an actual failing test repo. That will likely uncover any minor bugs (e.g. path issues, or missing dependencies like the `pytest-json-report` plugin which the Pytest tool expects). One minor thing to correct: in the initial dependency list they used **`typer[all]`**, which can cause a warning about an invalid extra. The plan noted switching to `typer>=0.12` without extras. If that hasn’t been done, you might see a pip warning; it’s a quick fix in pyproject to tidy that up. Similarly, ensure the `pytest-json-report` plugin is included (it looks like they intended it, possibly via `pytest` extras or `junitparser`). These are small packaging details to double-check.

Finally, **module exports**: It’s good to verify that the CLI and other modules can import what they need from the `nova` package. The plan called for adding `__init__.py` re-exports (e.g. `nova.agent.__init__` exporting `build_agent`, `nova.sdk.__init__` exporting a high-level `NovaAgent` class if any). If the code doesn’t have those, the CLI might be importing from deep module paths (which is fine). This is more about API neatness: if you want external code to do `from nova.sdk import NovaAgent`, you’d implement that class or alias. Given the CLI uses `build_agent` internally, having a `NovaAgent.run()` interface could be a nice-to-have, but not required for the happy path. So integration-wise, not having those exports only affects convenience, not correctness.

## Remaining Tasks to Reach the Happy Path 🎯

To get from the current state to a fully working **“red→green” happy path**, here’s what needs to be done next:

1. **Verify & Polish the CLI Integration:** Now that `nova fix` and `nova eval` are in place, do a real trial run. Use a sample repo with a deliberately failing test and run `nova fix` on it. This will be the moment of truth to see everything working together. Likely, you’ll need to make small fixes as you test:

   * Ensure Nova can find failing tests initially. As noted, if failing test info isn’t being fed to the planner yet, implement an initial test run before planning. This could be done in the CLI right after starting telemetry: call the Pytest runner to get the list of failing tests, and provide that to the planner (possibly by initializing the AgentState with those failures or adjusting the planner prompt input). This step wasn’t explicitly in code yet, but it’s critical for autonomy.
   * After the agent finishes, confirm that it indeed made commits on the fix branch and that tests are now passing. If tests are still failing or it didn’t fix them, inspect the telemetry log and debug: it might be an issue with prompt quality or a tool limitation. Tweak prompts or logic as needed (this is part of the iterative tuning but not a “coding bug” per se).
   * Test the KeyboardInterrupt flow: start a run and cancel it, verifying that the repo is reset (no stray changes) and the program exits cleanly with a log message. This ensures the happy path has a happy “escape hatch” as well.
   * Minor UX improvements: For example, on successful run, the CLI could print something like “✅ Tests are green! Branch `nova-fix/1234` contains the fixes.” Currently it prints a summary; make sure that’s clear and celebratory enough for a success case (this is just polish).

2. **Complete the Evaluation Harness (Optional for MVP):** The `nova eval` command is working using a simple loop inside the CLI, but Task 14 (a more structured eval runner in code) is still open. For the immediate goal of a happy path, running a single repo is enough. However, soon after, you’ll want to use `nova eval` to measure success rates. To finish this:

   * Implement `src/nova/eval/runner.py` with a `run_batch(config_path, settings)` function (if you prefer to separate it). This function would read the YAML and handle running the agent for each repo programmatically (similar to what the CLI does now). The CLI can then call this function and focus just on argument parsing.
   * Ensure the eval results JSON includes all important metrics (the plan suggested collecting success, duration, iterations, and which tools were used per run). The CLI already writes to a timestamped JSON; just confirm format and content.
   * This isn’t blocking the single-repo happy path, but it’s part of the acceptance criteria (≥70% fix rate on the eval suite), so it will be needed soon.

3. **Wire Up Full Telemetry (Trace Logging):** As mentioned, integrate the telemetry logger calls into each agent node now (Task 15). This means in code, after each major action, do something like `logger.log_event("planner", {...})` with relevant data. Particularly log:

   * The plan steps returned by the Planner (maybe the list of step descriptions).
   * The diff snippet produced by the Actor (you can truncate it if too large) and which file(s) it’s modifying.
   * The Critic’s decision (approved/rejected and any reason if available).
   * Test results after each run (e.g. “2 failed, 45 passed; still failing: test\_xyz.py::TestFoo”).
   * Any reflection or next-step decision info.
     Logging these will greatly help in debugging and verifying that the agent is behaving correctly. It’s also useful for users to inspect what Nova did. The TelemetryRun/JSONLLogger is ready for this; you just need to sprinkle the calls in the right spots. Also save each diff as a file artifact (the plan suggests storing patches under `telemetry/<run_id>/diffs/step-N.patch`).
   * Once done, do another test run and then open the `.nova/runs/…/trace.jsonl` file to ensure it recorded the sequence of events clearly.

4. **Final Package Checks (Installation & Usage):** Perform the “fresh install” test: in a clean environment, `pip install` the package (or `pip install -e .` for editable) and try the CLI as a user would. This flushes out any packaging issues:

   * Ensure the entry point works (`nova --help`). If not, check that `nova/cli.py` is being included in the package (it should, since `packages = find:` will catch `src/nova`). Also confirm the entry point in pyproject (which points to `nova.cli:app`) is correct and not stale (we changed CLI location from `apps/cli/nova.py`). It appears updated, so just verify.
   * The dependency on `pytest-json-report`: If the Pytest runner expects `--json-report`, make sure `pip install novasolve-ci-auto-rescue` brings in that plugin. It might not, since that plugin is a separate package (`pytest-json-report`). If it’s missing, either include it in pyproject or change strategy (they used `--json-report` flag which requires the plugin). Alternatively, they parse JUnit XML via `junitparser`, which *is* listed as a dependency. Double-check how `pytest_runner` is implemented. If using JUnit XML output (`--junitxml`), ensure `junitparser` is installed (they did list it). If using `--json-report`, add that plugin to deps. This is a small fix to avoid a situation where Nova runs tests but doesn’t get results because the report wasn’t generated.
   * Address the **Typer extra** if not done: change `typer[all]` to just `typer>=0.12` in pyproject to avoid installation warnings. This won’t break anything, but it’s easy to clean up.
   * Check that `nova.sdk` or other modules don’t have any import issues. For example, the CLI uses `build_agent` from the agent module. In the code they likely do `from nova.agent.graph import build_agent`. It works, but you might consider importing it via `nova.agent` (with an `__init__.py` export) for clarity. Not critical, but it aligns with the plan’s note about package exports.
   * Run `nova fix --help` and `nova eval --help` to see that all options are documented correctly (Typer does this automatically). This is just to verify the user experience.

5. **Documentation & Example:** Write a quick **README update** to guide the first users (this was Task 16). At minimum, document how to install and run the tool on a sample repo. Since the happy path is our focus, include a one-liner: “Install with pip, set your OPENAI\_API\_KEY, then run `nova fix /path/to/your/project` – Nova will create a branch and attempt to fix failing tests automatically.” Also mention where to find logs (the `.nova/` directory) and how to revert if needed (e.g. “If something goes wrong, checkout your original branch; Nova never pushes to main automatically.”). This will ensure anyone trying the happy path can follow it smoothly. You can fill out more details later (like the architecture docs, etc.), but a concise Quickstart is key.

6. **Real-World Test & Tuning:** After all the above, pick a real failing test scenario (perhaps one of the OSS projects you seeded with flaky tests) and run Nova end-to-end. This will be the validation of the happy path. Observe:

   * Does Nova actually fix the issue within a few iterations? If it struggles, you may need to adjust the prompt templates or logic (for example, if it keeps making irrelevant changes, maybe the Critic should be stricter or the planner should limit steps).
   * Are the model calls staying within reasonable token limits and cost? (Maybe try with a smaller model first to be safe.) If you hit context issues, consider narrowing the prompt (e.g., include only the failing test and the function under test, rather than entire files).
   * Ensure that if Nova cannot fix something, it surfaces that clearly (the agent should eventually give up and mark failure). The CLI currently will print a summary with `success: False` in that case. You might want to add a message like “Nova could not fix the tests in time. Inspect .nova/trace.jsonl for details.” – again, user communication.
   * Take note of any *new* failing tests introduced. The agent shouldn’t break other tests, but if it does, that’s a bug to iron out. The Critic or Reflect logic might need to catch that (e.g., if the number of failing tests increases, maybe revert that patch).

By completing those steps, you’ll go from the current prototype to a **working MVP** that meets the goal: *“nova fix CLI runs locally and produces fully passing tests with no manual intervention”*. The code is mostly there; it’s now about tightening the screws, testing in practice, and filling the small gaps (initial test detection, full telemetry, docs).

Once the happy path is confirmed on one repo, you can confidently tackle the remaining polish items (like documentation, and then those stretch features in P1/P2 if needed). But the above will get you “over the line” for the MVP. Good luck – you’re very close! 🚀
