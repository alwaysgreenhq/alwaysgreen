# Loop Prevention Implementation Summary

## Changes Applied

### 1. Enhanced AgentState (src/nova/agent/state.py)
- Added `used_actions` set to track (tool_name, args, modification_count) tuples
- Added `modifications_count` counter that increments when files are modified
- Added `file_cache` dictionary to cache file contents
- Added `increment_modifications()` method to increment counter and clear cache

### 2. File Caching in EnhancedLLMAgent (src/nova/agent/llm_agent_enhanced.py)
- Added `_read_file_with_cache()` method to cache file reads
- Modified `generate_patch()` to accept state parameter
- Updated all file reading to use cached version
- Cache keys include modification count to invalidate after changes

### 3. State Updates in ApplyPatchNode (src/nova/nodes/apply_patch.py)
- Added call to `state.increment_modifications()` after successful patch application
- This ensures cache is cleared when files are modified

### 4. Updated Method Calls
- cli.py: Pass state to generate_patch()
- nodes/actor.py: Pass state to generate_patch()

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Re-reading Files**: Files are cached during each iteration, reducing redundant file I/O
2. **Loop Prevention**: Tracks operations to prevent repeating the same actions
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Cache is cleared when files are modified, ensuring fresh reads
4. **Backward Compatible**: Uses hasattr checks to work with older code

## Key Differences from Old Implementation

The old implementation used:
- Unified tools system with SKIP messages
- Per-tool loop prevention
- Complex action tracking

Our implementation uses:
- Simple file caching at the agent level
- State-based modification tracking
- Automatic cache invalidation on changes

This is simpler but achieves the main goal of preventing file re-reading loops while being compatible with the current architecture.
